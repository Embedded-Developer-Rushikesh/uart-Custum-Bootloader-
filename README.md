UART Bootloader for STM32
Developed a robust UART-based bootloader for STM32 microcontrollers, supporting commands like version fetch, flash erase, memory write, and application jump. Ensured CRC validation, ACK/NACK response, address verification, and flash programming using HAL drivers for reliable firmware updates.
